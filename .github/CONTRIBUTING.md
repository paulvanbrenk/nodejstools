## Contributing Issues

- Use a descriptive title that identifies the issue to be addressed or the requested feature (e.g., "Feature F
should report ABC when XYZ is used in DEF").
- Provide a detailed description of the issue or request feature.
- For bug reports, please also:
	- Describe the expected behavior and the actual behavior.

## Submitting a Pull Request
In order to help us improve code quality and make NTVS better in general, here are some simple guidelines for
pull requests:

- Clearly state what the pull request accomplishes.
    - If it's a bug fix, what was the bug and how has it been fixed?
    - If you're adding a new feature, explain the feature and its use cases.
- Provide a high level explanation of your changes. This will help reviewers understand implementation choices
and will speed up the review process.
    - Try to keep pull requests small and focused.
- There is no formal code style-guide, but please try to match the style of any file you are editing. There is
an `.editorconfig`
 checked in the repo, which should help with this.

All pull requests are reviewed by one of the project maintainers before being merged in. 
If you are unsure of anything, feel free to ask. We're always happy to help.
